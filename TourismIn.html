                     celebrated city, on account of its commercial intercourse with people of all nationalities of the East who bring<br>
                      there the products of their respective countries, articles of merchandize, necessaries of life and other commodities<br>
                       in great abundance because every year more than a thousand ships touch there laden with cargo’ ‘as for the multitude<br>

                        One would say that a fair was being held every day for the sale of all sorts of merchandise.’

               <p>
                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.<br>
                 It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his<br>
                  favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque<br>
                   and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.<br>
                   Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project<br>
                    for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost<br>
                     estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be
                      approximately 52.8 billion<br> rupees (U.S. $827 million).
